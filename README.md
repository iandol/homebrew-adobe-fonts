# Adobe-fonts

Adobe made a questionable decision to rename their Source family of fonts to include the version number. This led to the hardworking maintainers of Homebrew deciding to use the Google version of the fonts, which are however outdated. If you need the latest versions and are willing to deal with the renamed families, then you can install them from this tap.
